This repository is a collection of the work I completed for the [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning?) provided by deeplearning.ai on Coursera, which contains 5 courses in total. There is no folder for Course 3 because there were no programming assignments for that course. Check out my credential [here](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/certificate/D8X7QBJN9X2V).
